About Me

My dream is to become an XR (Extended Reality) Developer, specializing in immersive experiences using Unity 3D. As an XR developer, I aim to blend creativity with cutting-edge technology, designing interactive environments for Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) applications.

Key Skills & Interests:

- XR Technologies: Building for VR headsets (Oculus, HTC Vive), AR platforms (ARCore, ARKit), and MR devices (HoloLens).
- C# Programming: Writing efficient, reusable code to power interactive worlds and user interfaces.
- 3D Design & Animation: Collaborating with artists or using tools like Blender for assets and visual effects.
- UX for Immersive Media: Creating intuitive and engaging user experiences in spatial environments.

Why XR Development?

XR excites me because it pushes the boundaries of how we interact with digital content, from gaming and entertainment to education, healthcare, and industry. I am passionate about crafting virtual worlds that feel real, encourage exploration, and deliver positive impact.

Goals:
- Become a certified Unity XR developer.
- Build portfolio projects across VR/AR/MR platforms.
- Join a forward-thinking team shaping the future of immersive technology.

Let’s connect and create reality beyond imagination!
